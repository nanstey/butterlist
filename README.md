###*Your smart to-do list web app!* 
</p>
Isn't it annoying when someone suggests a song, book or movie that you want to check out later and don't have a pen! Enter, BUTTERLIST!

***Butterlist*** is an app for organizing and optimizing your ongoing lists. Every item you add will be automatically categorized for you. Your item will be shown with a link to the associated item for you to check out ratings, reviews or to buy that item! Disagree with how your item was categorized? Simply drag it to another category and voila! Check your list off as you no longer need them to keep track! 

Once logged in you can start adding items to your personal list. Clicking on existing items with **mark them as complete** (try it out!). Each list item has a **trash icon** that will permanently remove it from your list. Don't worry, your list items won't disappear when you logout!

Your list items **link icon** will take you to a relevant link based on your item and it's current category. Changed the category? The link is also updated and will be relevant to the new category.
