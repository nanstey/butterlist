###*Your smart to-do list web app!* 
</p>

***Butterlist*** is an app for organizing and optimizing your ongoing to-do list. Every item you add will be automatically categorized for you. Disagree with how your item was categorized? Simply drag it to another category! 

Once logged in you can start adding items to your personal list. Clicking on existing items with **mark them as complete** (try it out!). Each list item has a **trash icon** that will permanently remove it from your list. Your items and their previous status are there for you every time you log in.

On the left side of your list items there is a **link icon**. This will take you to a relevant link based on your item and it's current category. Changed the category? The link is also updated and will be relevant to the new category.

##Butter's better.
